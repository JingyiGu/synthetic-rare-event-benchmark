# Synthetic Rare Event Datasets and Survey

This repository provides a comprehensive list of datasets used in research on **synthetic data generation for rare or extreme events** across multiple domains, including finance, climate, energy, and more.

The goal is to **consolidate links and metadata** in one place to support researchers building or evaluating rare-event generative models.

- 🔗 Centralized access to public datasets for rare event modeling
- 📚 Companion to the survey: *Synthetic Data Generation for Rare Events: Methods, Metrics, and Benchmarks* (2025)
- 📊 Categorized across modalities: time series, images, tabular, graph
